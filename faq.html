    <h3>1. What is climate change?</h3>
    <p>
        Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns,
        caused mainly by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation,
        and industrial processes.
    </p>

    <h3>2. What are the main greenhouse gases?</h3>
    <p>
        The major greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄),
        nitrous oxide (N₂O), and fluorinated gases. CO₂ is the most widely produced.
    </p>

    <h3>3. How do we know climate change is real?</h3>
    <p>
        Scientists use satellite data, ice cores, temperature records, and ocean research.
        The overwhelming scientific consensus is that the Earth is warming and humans are
        the primary cause.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Can an individual really make a difference?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes! Personal choices—reducing waste, cutting energy use, choosing sustainable
        products, and educating others—scale up when millions of people act.
    </p>

    <h3>5. What countries contribute the most to climate change?</h3>
    <p>
        The largest contributors are countries with high industrial output and energy use,
        especially the United States, China, India, and countries in the EU.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Is it too late to stop climate change?</h3>
    <p>
        No. While some effects are irreversible, strong global action can slow warming,
        protect vulnerable ecosystems, and prevent more severe consequences.
