    <p>
        Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mostly caused by human
        activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial waste. These changes are occurring
        faster than at any point in recorded history.

    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
    <p>
        Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to rise. This leads to melting
        glaciers, rising sea levels, extreme weather patterns, and the loss of ecosystems that thousands of species
        depend on—including humans.
