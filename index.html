    <h2>Our Planet Is Changing</h2>

    <p>
        Climate change refers to long-term alterations in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns,
        and other elements of the Earth's climate system. While climate naturally changes over time,
        the rapid warming we are experiencing today is caused primarily by human activities.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since the Industrial Revolution, global temperatures have risen by more than 1.1°C. This rapid warming
        has affected ecosystems, oceans, and weather systems in ways we have never seen before.
        Human-driven climate change—known as anthropogenic climate change—comes mainly from burning fossil fuels,
        deforestation, and large-scale agriculture.
    </p>

    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>

    <p>
        Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap heat in the atmosphere,
        causing a “blanket effect.” This intensifies natural warming and disrupts the balance of Earth’s climate.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some consequences are already visible:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Melting glaciers and ice sheets</li>
        <li>Rising sea levels affecting coastal cities</li>
        <li>More intense hurricanes, floods, and wildfires</li>
        <li>Disruption of animal migration and extinction of vulnerable species</li>
        <li>Increasing global food and water insecurity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The last decade was the hottest ever recorded. Ocean heat content is at a record high, and over
        1 million species are currently at risk of extinction due to climatic shifts.
